This year&#8217;s default theme is overseen by <a href="http://ma.tt">Matt Mullenweg</a>, and built by <a href="http://noscope.com">Joen Asmussen</a>, <a href="http://en.wp.obenland.it">Konstantin Obenland</a>, and <a href="http://simpledream.net">Lance Willett</a>.</p>\n<p>The goal for Twenty Thirteen is to offer &#8220;a focus on blogging, and great support for post formats (which are getting <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/post-formats/">attention</a> on the backend in 3.6 as well).&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to see the theme in action, <a href="http://twentythirteendemo.wordpress.com">a demo site</a> is available. One thing you&#8217;ll notice immediately is that the strong emphasis on whitespace, which has become commonplace in the default themes, is long-gone. Twenty Thirteen is making very bold use of its colors, offering a different color for each post format. The theme also lacks a sidebar by default. It&#8217;s designed to focus on blogging after all, so the designers prefer that you leave your widgets to the footer area, but it still does support a sidebar widget area if you really want to put something there.</p>\n<p>This theme won&#8217;t be for everyone, and really no default theme should. Default themes should showcase the strength of each release&#8217;s new features and inspire customization. If you aren&#8217;t a fan of Twenty Thirteen, don&#8217;t worry, there are still <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/">over 1,600 themes</a> to choose from, including <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve">Twenty Twelve</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/3tj7MIPbhOc" height="1" width="1"

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/numbers/">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.5" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

(Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.) And despite all of the changes to media, we&#8217;re still aiming to be backwards compatible with plugins that make changes to the existing media library.

SimplePie <del>1.3</del> 1.3.1. jQuery <del>1.8.2</del> 1.8.3. jQuery UI <del>1.9 (and it&#8217;s not even released yet)</del> 1.9.2. We&#8217;ve also added Backbone 0.9.2 and Underscore <del>1.3.3</del> 1.4.2, and you can use protocol-relative links when enqueueing scripts and styles. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16560">#16560</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>WP Query:</strong> You can now ask to receive posts in the order specified by <code>post__in</code>. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13729">#13729</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>XML-RPC:</strong> New user management, profile editing, and post revision methods.

Also: You can now use multisite in a subdirectory, and uploaded files no longer go through ms-files (for new installs).

(<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21812">#21812</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Posts API: </strong>Major performance improvements when working with hierarchies of pages and post ancestors.

It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

users could upload their photo to and get their face matched to a dog which is up for adoption at the SPCA. The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database.

It was to allow the users to get involved in the discussions the presenters were having and even get their comments to appear in real time on live TV. It was also to create a sense of community within the users friends by allowing them to invite their friends to watch the show and also display a list of which of your friends were currently tuned in via the app.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built on the Zend Framework and implements the Facebook API, JQuery, AJAX, a custom scroll bar JS library and of course HTML &amp; CSS.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nThe main challenge was that discussion feed needed to have the same user experience as Facebook but the feed functionality isn''t part of the Facebook API and it needed to poll the server to add new comments without refreshing. The app also had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends. Integrating a Facebook app with a live TV show was a first for me and actually a world wide first which caught the attention of a lot of people in technology sphere.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis app was featured on the Facebook developer blog and was also featured on quite a few online newspapers and blogs.\r\n<h3>Additional</h3>\r\nThe site has undergone a design overhaul since we launched it back in 2010 but its still up and running: <a title="Ulive facebook app" href="https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/" target="_blank">https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/</a>', 'Ulive', 'This project encompassed a wide range of web technologies.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

The voting section needed to display comments in two columns depending on what you voted for and also auto-update. The video stream of the show needed to only be active when the show was on but also automatically load the show when the show started if the user had the window open. The app had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Method</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe polls worked in much the same way but with the added complication that you couldn''t comment until you''d voted and that your vote was displayed under the option you voted for. This meant that if a lot more people voted and commented on 1 option than the other, we''d get into a situation where if we were a few pages back in the comments, we end up with just 1 column displaying on the page which needed to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe video stream was implemented with a 3rd party flash video streamer. It''s controls were pretty basic and this was one of the easier things to implement. We had a few problems around the video continuing to play after the slide down was closed or not starting when the shows start time clicked over. Some browsers seemed to continue the streaming even if the object was removed from the DOM, so it was important to get the video actually stopped and unloaded before hiding it or removing it from the DOM.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends. Integrating a Facebook app with a live TV show was a first for me and actually a world wide first which caught the attention of a lot of people in technology sphere.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis app was featured on the Facebook developer blog and was also featured on quite a few online news papers and tech blogs.', 'Ulive', 'This project encompassed a wide range of web technologies.

It was to allow the users to get involved in the discussions the presenters were having and even get their comments to appear in real time on live TV. It was also to create a sense of community within the users friends by allowing them to invite their friends to watch the show and also display a list of which of your friends were currently tuned in via the app.\r\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\r\nThis project was built on the Zend Framework and implements the Facebook API, JQuery, AJAX, a custom scroll bar JS library and of course HTML &amp; CSS.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nThe discussion feed needed to have the same user experience as Facebook but the feed functionality isn''t part of the Facebook API and it needed to poll the server to add new comments without refreshing. The voting section needed to display comments in two columns depending on what you voted for and also auto-update. The video stream of the show needed to only be active when the show was on but also automatically load the show when the show started if the user had the window open. The app had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Methods</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe polls worked in much the same way but with the added complication that you couldn''t comment until you''d voted and that your vote was displayed under the option you voted for. This meant that if a lot more people voted and commented on 1 option than the other, we''d get into a situation where if we were a few pages back in the comments, we end up with just 1 column displaying on the page which needed to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe video stream was implemented with a 3rd party flash video streamer. It''s controls were pretty basic and this was one of the easier things to implement. We had a few problems around the video continuing to play after the slide down was closed or not starting when the shows start time clicked over. Some browsers seemed to continue the streaming even if the object was removed from the DOM, so it was important to get the video actually stopped and unloaded before hiding it or removing it from the DOM.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends. Integrating a Facebook app with a live TV show was a first for me and actually a world wide first which caught the attention of a lot of people in technology sphere.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis app was featured on the Facebook developer blog and was also featured on quite a few online newspapers and blogs.', 'Ulive', 'This project encompassed a wide range of web technologies.

There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends. Integrating a Facebook app with a live TV show was a first for me and actually a world wide first which caught the attention of a lot of people in technology sphere.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis app was featured on the Facebook developer blog and was also featured on quite a few online newspapers and blogs.\r\n<h3>Additional</h3>\r\nThe site has undergone a design overhaul since we launched it back in 2010 but its still up and running: <a title="Ulive facebook app" href="https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/" target="_blank">https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/</a>', 'Ulive', 'This project encompassed a wide range of web technologies.

The voting section needed to display comments in two columns depending on what you voted for and also auto-update. The video stream of the show needed to only be active when the show was on but also automatically load the show when the show started if the user had the window open.

It''s controls were pretty basic and this was one of the easier things to implement. We had a few problems around the video continuing to play after the slide down was closed or not starting when the shows start time clicked over.

It was to allow the users to get involved in the discussions the presenters were having and even get their comments to appear in real time on live TV. It was also to create a sense of community within the users friends by allowing them to invite their friends to watch the show and also display a list of which of your friends were currently tuned in via the app.\r\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\r\nThis project was built on the Zend Framework and implements the Facebook API, JQuery, AJAX, a custom scroll bar JS library and of course HTML &amp; CSS.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nThe discussion feed needed to have the same user experience as Facebook but the feed functionality isn''t part of the Facebook API and it needed to poll the server to add new comments without refreshing. The voting section needed to display comments in two columns depending on what you voted for and also auto-update. The video stream of the show needed to only be active when the show was on but also automatically load the show when the show started if the user had the window open. The app had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe polls worked in much the same way but with the added complication that you couldn''t comment until you''d voted and that your vote was displayed under the option you voted for. This meant that if a lot more people voted and commented on 1 option than the other, we''d get into a situation where if we were a few pages back in the comments, we end up with just 1 column displaying on the page which needed to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe video stream was implemented with a 3rd party flash video streamer. It''s controls were pretty basic and this was one of the easier things to implement. We had a few problems around the video continuing to play after the slide down was closed or not starting when the shows start time clicked over. Some browsers seemed to continue the streaming even if the object was removed from the DOM, so it was important to get the video actually stopped and unloaded before hiding it or removing it from the DOM.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others. It was also featured on Campbell Live when it first launched.', 'Doggelganger', 'Doggelganger used security grade facial recognition software to match your face with a dog who is up for adoption from the SPCA animal shelter.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\n<h3>Technology</h3>\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page. When the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\n<h3>Results</h3>\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

It was to allow the users to get involved in the discussions the presenters were having and even get their comments to appear in real time on live TV. It was also to create a sense of community within the users friends by allowing them to invite their friends to watch the show and also display a list of which of your friends were currently tuned in via the app.\r\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\r\nThis project was built on the Zend Framework and implements the Facebook API, JQuery, AJAX, a custom scroll bar JS library and of course HTML &amp; CSS.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nThe discussion feed needed to have the same user experience as Facebook but the feed functionality isn''t part of the Facebook API and it needed to poll the server to add new comments without refreshing. The voting section needed to display comments in two columns depending on what you voted for and also auto-update. The video stream of the show needed to only be active when the show was on but also automatically load the show when the show started if the user had the window open. The app had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe polls worked in much the same way but with the added complication that you couldn''t comment until you''d voted and that your vote was displayed under the option you voted for. This meant that if a lot more people voted and commented on 1 option than the other, we''d get into a situation where if we were a few pages back in the comments, we end up with just 1 column displaying on the page which needed to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe video stream was implemented with a 3rd party flash video streamer. It''s controls were pretty basic and this was one of the easier things to implement. We had a few problems around the video continuing to play after the slide down was closed or not starting when the shows start time clicked over. Some browsers seemed to continue the streaming even if the object was removed from the DOM, so it was important to get the video actually stopped and unloaded before hiding it or removing it from the DOM.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends.

It was to allow the users to get involved in the discussions the presenters were having and even get their comments to appear in real time on live TV. It was also to create a sense of community within the users friends by allowing them to invite their friends to watch the show and also display a list of which of your friends were currently tuned in via the app.\r\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\r\nThis project was built on the Zend Framework and implements the Facebook API, JQuery, AJAX, a custom scroll bar JS library and of course HTML &amp; CSS.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nThe discussion feed needed to have the same user experience as Facebook but the feed functionality isn''t part of the Facebook API and it needed to poll the server to add new comments without refreshing. The voting section needed to display comments in two columns depending on what you voted for and also auto-update. The video stream of the show needed to only be active when the show was on but also automatically load the show when the show started if the user had the window open. The app had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe polls worked in much the same way but with the added complication that you couldn''t comment until you''d voted and that your vote was displayed under the option you voted for. This meant that if a lot more people voted and commented on 1 option than the other, we''d get into a situation where if we were a few pages back in the comments, we end up with just 1 column displaying on the page which needed to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe video stream was implemented with a 3rd party flash video streamer. It''s controls were pretty basic and this was one of the easier things to implement. We had a few problems around the video continuing to play after the slide down was closed or not starting when the shows start time clicked over. Some browsers seemed to continue the streaming even if the object was removed from the DOM, so it was important to get the video actually stopped and unloaded before hiding it or removing it from the DOM.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC (facial recognition) APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after build, the project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud server so our web server didnt have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their image, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive images more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database lookup the table wasnt millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting out dogs from the SPCA shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others. It was also featured on Campbell Live when it first launched.', 'Doggelganger', 'Doggelganger used security grade facial recognition software to match your face with a dog who is up for adoption from the SPCA.

It was also to create a sense of community within the users friends by allowing them to invite their friends to watch the show and also display a list of which of your friends were currently tuned in via the app.\r\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\r\nThis project was built on the Zend Framework and implements the Facebook API, JQuery, AJAX, a custom scroll bar JS library and of course HTML &amp; CSS.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nThe discussion feed needed to have the same user experience as Facebook but the feed functionality isn''t part of the Facebook API and it needed to poll the server to add new comments without refreshing. The voting section needed to display comments in two columns depending on what you voted for and also auto-update. The video stream of the show needed to only be active when the show was on but also automatically load the show when the show started if the user had the window open. The app had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe polls worked in much the same way but with the added complication that you couldn''t comment until you''d voted and that your vote was displayed under the option you voted for. This meant that if a lot more people voted and commented on 1 option than the other, we''d get into a situation where if we were a few pages back in the comments, we end up with just 1 column displaying on the page which needed to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe video stream was implemented with a 3rd party flash video streamer. It''s controls were pretty basic and this was one of the easier things to implement. We had a few problems around the video continuing to play after the slide down was closed or not starting when the shows start time clicked over. Some browsers seemed to continue the streaming even if the object was removed from the DOM, so it was important to get the video actually stopped and unloaded before hiding it or removing it from the DOM.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends. Integrating a Facebook app with a live TV show was a first for me and actually a world wide first which caught the attention of a lot of people in technology sphere.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis app was featured on the Facebook developer blog and was also featured on quite a few online newspapers and blogs.\r\n<h3>Additional</h3>\r\nThe site has undergone a design overhaul since we launched it back in 2010 but its still up and running: <a title="Ulive facebook app" href="https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/" target="_blank">https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/</a>', 'Ulive', 'This project encompassed a wide range of web technologies.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the NEC (facial recognition) and Facebook APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after build, the project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud server so our web server didnt have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their image, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive images more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database lookup the table wasnt millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting out dogs from the SPCA shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others. It was also featured on Campbell Live when it first launched.', 'Doggelganger', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '372-revision-12', '', '', '2013-01-13 14:15:20', '2013-01-13 02:15:20', '', 372, 'http://localhost/techblog/articles/372-revision-12/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Some browsers seemed to continue the streaming even if the object was removed from the DOM, so it was important to get the video actually stopped and unloaded before hiding it or removing it from the DOM.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends. Integrating a Facebook app with a live TV show was a first for me and actually a world wide first which caught the attention of a lot of people in technology sphere.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis app was featured on the Facebook developer blog and was also featured on quite a few online newspapers and blogs.\r\n<h3>Additional</h3>\r\nThe site has undergone a design overhaul since we launched it back in 2010 but its still up and running: <a title="Ulive facebook app" href="https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/" target="_blank">https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/</a>', 'Doggelganger', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '372-revision-8', '', '', '2013-01-13 13:48:21', '2013-01-13 01:48:21', '', 372, 'http://localhost/techblog/articles/372-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the NEC and Facebook APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after build, the project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud server so our web server didnt have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their image, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive images more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database lookup the table wasnt millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting out dogs from the SPCA shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others. It was also featured on Campbell Live when it first launched.', 'Doggelganger', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '372-revision-11', '', '', '2013-01-13 14:15:02', '2013-01-13 02:15:02', '', 372, 'http://localhost/techblog/articles/372-revision-11/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It was to allow the users to get involved in the discussions the presenters were having and even get their comments to appear in real time on live TV. It was also to create a sense of community within the users friends by allowing them to invite their friends to watch the show and also display a list of which of your friends were currently tuned in via the app.\n<h3>Technology</h3>\nThis project was built on the Zend Framework and implements the Facebook API, JQuery, AJAX, a custom scroll bar JS library and of course HTML &amp; CSS.\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\nThe main challenge was that discussion feed needed to have the same user experience as Facebook but the feed functionality isn''t part of the Facebook API and it needed to poll the server to add new comments without refreshing. The app also had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\n\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\n\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\n<h3>Results</h3>\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others. It was also featured on Campbell Live when it first launched.', 'Bromitment', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'bromitment', '', '', '2013-01-16 20:15:37', '2013-01-16 08:15:37', '', 6, 'http://localhost/techblog/?page_id=426', 0, 'page', '', 0),

It was to allow the users to get involved in the discussions the presenters were having and even get their comments to appear in real time on live TV. It was also to create a sense of community within the users friends by allowing them to invite their friends to watch the show and also display a list of which of your friends were currently tuned in via the app.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built on the Zend Framework and implements the Facebook API, JQuery, AJAX, a custom scroll bar JS library and of course HTML &amp; CSS.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nThe main challenge was that discussion feed needed to have the same user experience as Facebook but the feed functionality isn''t part of the Facebook API and it needed to poll the server to add new comments without refreshing. The app also had to integrate with the users friends list and keep a track of who was online so we could display if any of your friends were watching and also have an invite mechanic. There was also the archiving of old discussions and polls as well as the feed moderation for the comments that went to air and CMS for the app.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nWe had to recreate the Facebook feed''s functionality from scratch with the added ability to flag posts for moderator review. This became a very difficult task when there''s so much integration. Every time we AJAX''d in a new set of posts we had to bump the same number off the bottom so the pagination was intact while keeping their indexes for the likes and times all correct. We had to update the posts times, amount of likes and comment totals and then once everything was loaded, refresh the custom scroll bar height. The scroll lock button paused new comments from auto-updating which was also quite difficult to get working seamlessly.\r\n\r\nConnecting people with their friends was an important part of the app. We kept a database record of the Facebook ID''s of everyone who logged into the app against a timestamp and if you''d polled our server in the last 30 seconds we considered you to be in current use of the app. We then would look at the logged in users friends list and cross section that with the people who are currently logged in and display their profile picture and a link to their profile in a grid under the X Friends Watching heading. From here you could also invite your friends to watch the show through the Ulive app and this was done with the Facebook API''s App Invite functionality.\r\n\r\nThe CMS was relatively straight forward, once a comment was approved to go to air it would be sent via a CURL request to an API at the TVNZ studio. This would then run through their system and be put up on the screen along with the users Name, Profile pic and Age which we got from their Facebook profile.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project turned out to be a great piece of programming. The integration of so many technologies ended up seeming pretty smooth despite having to do a lot of bug fixing and tying up loose ends. Integrating a Facebook app with a live TV show was a first for me and actually a world wide first which caught the attention of a lot of people in technology sphere.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis app was featured on the Facebook developer blog and was also featured on quite a few online newspapers and blogs.\r\n<h3>Additional</h3>\r\nThe site has undergone a design overhaul since we launched it back in 2010 but its still up and running: <a title="Ulive facebook app" href="https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/" target="_blank">https://apps.facebook.com/tvnz-ulive/</a>', 'Ulive', 'This project encompassed a wide range of web technologies.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\n<h3>Technology</h3>\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\n<div class="gallery"><a class="fancybox" title="The mobile site has its own bespoke layout to offer the tools relevant to the medium" href="http://localhost/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bnz-landing-mobile-1.jpg" rel="gallery2"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-520" alt="bnz-landing-mobile-1" src="http://localhost/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bnz-landing-mobile-1-200x200.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a><a class="fancybox" title="It still showed the same content modules but in full width single file" href="http://localhost/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bnz-landing-mobile-2.jpg" rel="gallery2"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-521" alt="bnz-landing-mobile-2" src="http://localhost/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bnz-landing-mobile-2-200x200.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a><a class="fancybox" title="You could also view the full article by clicking on the content item" href="http://localhost/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bnz-landing-mobile-3.jpg" rel="gallery2"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-522" alt="bnz-landing-mobile-3" src="http://localhost/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bnz-landing-mobile-3-200x200.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a><a class="fancybox" title="Contact us and Join us both triggered slide in panels from the left" href="http://localhost/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bnz-landing-mobile-4.jpg" rel="gallery2"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-523" alt="bnz-landing-mobile-4" src="http://localhost/techblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bnz-landing-mobile-4-200x200.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a></div>\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed. The core idea was great, it was easy to use, it was fun and the main goal of adopting dogs from the SPCA animal shelters exceeded expectation.\r\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\r\nThis site has won numerous awards including the Grand Axis, Gold Cannes, Spikes, Caples and many others.

It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day.

The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook.

The premise being that owners often look like their pets.\r\n<h3>Technology</h3>\r\nThis project was built in Flash with the CMS and API built on the Zend Framework. It also implements the Facebook and NEC APIs.\r\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\r\nA lot of the heavy lifting was left up to NEC. Their security grade facial recognition software which was accessed via an API handled the facial scanning and matching functionality. The main challenges for us was to capture the images, save them to the database and provide a URL for each result that could be shared on facebook with all the relevant meta data. The real challenge however arose after the build finished. The project went viral and was receiving over 100,000 hits per day. Streamlining the server side code and using better data access techniques to stop the database crashing under such a heavy load was quite technical.\r\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\r\nImages were first captured by the flash and sent to the server as a base64 image string. The PHP then used the GD library to merge the users image, the dogs image and the doggelganger logo onto a yellow background and resize it to become the image which would be shared by Facebook. We would also resize and save the user and dog images individually along with the NEC match statistics to be displayed on the share page.\r\n\r\nWhen the project went viral we had to implement a number of things to stop the server from crashing. We moved the flash file itself to an Amazon cloud servers so our web server didn''t have to send it out every time it was requested. We found that the main bottleneck was around reading and writing to the database so we tried to limit the number of database calls to a minimum. We kept as many recent records as we could in memcache so that when the user shared their match, it could hopefully just get pulled from memory instead of the database. The other thing we did was archive matches more than 5 days old so that when we were doing a database look up the table wasn''t millions of rows long. All of these things combined with a queuing system allowed the server to tick over quite nicely despite the huge volume of traffic.\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\nThis project was both simple and well executed.
